<p>This repository provides information about scraping images from Google using <b>python</b></p>
<p>Used <b>Selenium module</b> since it will be flexible to use this module when trying to scrape images, because when we can't see the href link of the image directly we inspect the page, So until we click on the image to inspect.</p>
